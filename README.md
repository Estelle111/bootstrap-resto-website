## Description

* have an automatic open/closed schedule in Location section
* ask user name when page load

## Tools

* scss
* bootstrap

## Challenges 
I encountered a lot of problems due to time, lack of javascript knowledge, difficulties to get priorities.
I spent to much time with esthetic in the begining and javascript in the end.
* I used a side navbar, it gave me problems with responsivity
* Javascript code for open/closed schedule works
* I couldnt make my prompt working only once. So, I put it in comments for now.
* Couldn't get glyphicons
